# LambdaDatabasesManager
I had problems with PhpMyAdmin and Adminer, so I decided to develop my own databases management tool. It is build with PHP 7.4 & PDO. For now only supports MySQL, but I am going to add support for other database engines.

LDM is in development, but if you want to help with development, find me on Discord (LambdaTheDev#2594) or send me an e-mail: skagamerpl@gmail.com.

#Features

- Developed with new PHP versions,
- Good-looking GUI,
- Not creates useless databases
- Takes not much memory
